Welcome to "EnemyUnknown" mod for Rimworld

If you want to ask yes its mod inspired by XCOM (not only newest one but by whole series).

What I plan for this mod? 
A lots of Researches (about 100 new reasearch will be avalible)
Some weapons (yet I play 13 new weapons)
Lots of buildable structures (not only defensive)
New research facility which improve speed of research
New enemyes (of coure the old Xcom enemyes)
Better Agriculture system
Even binoic and surgery system

If you want to help me, just send me your proposals and maybe something I take and implement into mod.
